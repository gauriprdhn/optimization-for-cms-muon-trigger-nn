## Model Compression Using Iterative Pruning:

This library can be used to perform iterative pruning on a TF/Keras model using custom keras layer.
The underlying notebooks can be used to study how the package can be used to perform iterative pruning on a neural network used for regression.
***
To install the library run the following steps from your terminal:

1. Pull the package from git via `git clone https://github.com/gauriprdhn/optimization-for-cms-muon-trigger-nn.git`
2. `cd` to the directory where `setup.py` is present on the local system.
3. Run `python3 setup.py install` to install the necessary backups and scripts as a package.
